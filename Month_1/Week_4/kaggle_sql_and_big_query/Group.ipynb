    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you can select raw data, you're ready to learn how to group your data and count things within those groups. This can help you answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    How many of each kind of fruit has our store sold?\n",
    "    How many species of animal has the vet office treated?\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you'll learn about three new techniques: GROUP BY, HAVING and COUNT(). Once again, we'll use this made-up table of information on pets."

    "## COUNT()\n",
    "COUNT(), as you may have guessed from the name, returns a count of things. If you pass it the name of a column, it will return the number of entries in that column.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we SELECT the COUNT() of the ID column in the pets table, it will return 4, because there are 4 ID's in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "COUNT() is an example of an aggregate function, which takes many values and returns one. (Other examples of aggregate functions include SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX().) As you'll notice in the picture above, aggregate functions introduce strange column names (like f0__). Later in this tutorial, you'll learn how to change the name to something more descriptive."

    "For example, say we want to know how many of each type of animal we have in the pets table. We can use GROUP BY to group together rows that have the same value in the Animal column, while using COUNT() to find out how many ID's we have in each group."

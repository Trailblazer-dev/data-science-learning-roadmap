# Week 2: Python for Data Science

## Overview
This week focuses on essential Python libraries for data science: NumPy, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks. These tools form the foundation of any data analysis workflow.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand NumPy arrays and operations
- Master Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Get comfortable with Jupyter notebooks
- Perform basic data cleaning and preprocessing
- Apply descriptive statistics to datasets

## Projects

### Project: Pandas Data Science Tasks
- Working with the [Pandas Data Science Tasks](https://github.com/Trailblazer-dev/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks) repository
- This repository contains real-world data science tasks completed using pandas
- Analyze sales data across different stores and products
- Practice data cleaning, transformation, and analysis techniques
- Extract actionable business insights

## Sample Code

Our `myscript.py` contains a simple example of a Python function:

```python
def square(x):
    """Returns the square of x."""
    return x**2

for N in range(1,4):
    print(f"{N} squared is {square(N)}")
```

## Progress Tracking

- [ ] Complete NumPy exercises
- [ ] Complete Pandas basics
- [ ] Work through the Pandas Data Science Tasks repository
- [ ] Document key insights from the sales data analysis
- [ ] Create final Jupyter notebook summarizing learnings
- [ ] Share results and methodologies used

## Next Steps
After completing this week, you'll be ready to move on to data visualization in Week 3, where you'll learn to create compelling visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

    "Since it's not always easy to decide how to best tell the story behind your data, we've broken the chart types into three broad categories to help with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“ˆ Trends\n",
    "A trend is defined as a pattern of change.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sns.lineplot` â€“ Line charts are best to show trends over a period of time, and multiple lines can be used to show trends in more than one group.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”— Relationship\n",
    "These chart types help you understand relationships between variables in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sns.barplot` â€“ Bar charts are useful for comparing quantities corresponding to different groups.\n",
    "- `sns.heatmap` â€“ Heatmaps can be used to find color-coded patterns in tables of numbers.\n",
    "- `sns.scatterplot` â€“ Scatter plots show the relationship between two continuous variables; if color-coded, we can also show the relationship with a third categorical variable.\n",
    "- `sns.regplot` â€“ Including a regression line in the scatter plot makes it easier to see any linear relationship between two variables.\n",
    "- `sns.lmplot` â€“ Useful for drawing multiple regression lines, if the scatter plot contains multiple, color-coded groups.\n",
    "- `sns.swarmplot` â€“ Categorical scatter plots show the relationship between a continuous variable and a categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ“Š Distribution\n",
    "We visualize distributions to show the possible values we can expect to see in a variable, along with how likely they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sns.histplot` â€“ Histograms show the distribution of a single numerical variable.\n",
    "- `sns.kdeplot` â€“ KDE plots (or 2D KDE plots) show an estimated, smooth distribution of a single numerical variable (or two numerical variables).\n",
    "- `sns.jointplot` â€“ Useful for simultaneously displaying a 2D KDE plot with the corresponding KDE plots for each individual variable.\n"
